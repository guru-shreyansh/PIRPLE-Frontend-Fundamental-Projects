# PIRPLE-Frontend-Fundamental-Projects
This project consists of various Assignments/Projects which were part of the Assessments of the #Pirple's "Frontend Fundamental" course. These includes designing of a doppelganger of the Facebook homepage, webpage containing recipe of your favourite dish, designing a book/movie page of your choice using #HTML &amp; #CSS. Well designing a new page from scratch seems challenging as a beginner. But overall these were an engaging &amp; dexterous projects. #Lockdown #Pirple
