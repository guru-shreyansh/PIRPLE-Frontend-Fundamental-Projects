# **Facebook Homepage doppelganger**
### As a part of the *Final Assessment* of the #Pirple's "Frontend Fundamental" course, I've created a doppelganger of the *Facebook* homepage using #HTML & #CSS.
##### Well, designing a new page from scratch seems difficult but creating an exact copy of an existing page/site is also challenging 
(Inspect element acted as a helpmate tough).

Overall it was an engaging & dexterous project.
