# **Facebook Homepage doppelganger**
### As a part of the course *project*, I've designed a simple website about my favorite movie which is the Harry Potter Series!
##### As a part of the Final Assessment of the #Pirple's "Frontend Fundamental" course, I've created a doppelganger of the Facebook homepage using #HTML & #CSS.
Well designing a new page from scratch seems difficult but creating an exact copy of an existing page/site is also challenging 
(Inspect element acted as a helpmate tough).

Overall it was an engaging & dexterous project.
